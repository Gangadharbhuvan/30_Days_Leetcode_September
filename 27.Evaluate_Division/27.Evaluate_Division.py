    You are given equations in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating-point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.

 

Example 1:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
Example 2:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
Example 3:

Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
 

Constraints:

1 <= equations.length <= 20
equations[i].length == 2
1 <= equations[i][0], equations[i][1] <= 5
values.length == equations.length
0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0
1 <= queries.length <= 20
queries[i].length == 2
1 <= queries[i][0], queries[i][1] <= 5
equations[i][0], equations[i][1], queries[i][0], queries[i][1] consist of lower case English letters and digits.

Do you recognize this as a graph problem?
