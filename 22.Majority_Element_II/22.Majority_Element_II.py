'''
	Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times.

Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
   Hide Hint #1  
How many majority elements could it possibly have?
